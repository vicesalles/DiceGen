# Blender Dice Gen

A Blender add-on that generates polyhedral dice, with built-in resin fin supports for resin printing.

## Installation and usage

Download the [main python script](https://github.com/shawn-makes-stuff/DiceGen5.0/blob/main/DiceGen5.py), then go to `Edit > Preferences... > Add-ons > Install...` and select the file.

Afterwards you will be able to generate dice in `Add > Mesh > Dice` or `Sidebar > DiceGen5 > Add Dice to Scene`.

Each newly added die is placed in its own collection named after the dice type, with the body, numbers, and fin supports grouped together.

The add-on will create a blank dice mesh and, if enabled, a separate numbers object. The blank dice object will have a boolean modifier that has the "Realtime" flag turned off for performance reasons. Turn that on to see the result in the viewport.

## Supported dice

- D4 Tetrahedron
- D4 Crystal
- D4 Shard
- D6 Cube
- D8 Octahedron
- D10 Pentagonal Trepazohedron
- D100 Pentagonal Trepazohedron
- D12 Dodecahedron
- D20 Icosahedron
- Custom Crystal, any number of faces
- Custom Shard, any number of faces
- Custom Bipyramid, any even number of faces (not impossible geometry)
- Custom Trapezohedron, any number of even faces (not impossible geometry)

### New features

- Add a custom image to a face using an SVG
- Set dice type to sharp, chamfer, or bevel (these are done with a bevel modifier)
- Set dice type bumper (creates a "cage" around the dice corners, modifies dice mesh)
- Added new Dice Gen section to Object properties to allow quick configuration changes of individual dice
- Added new Dice Gen sidebar menu option to allow quickly creating multiple dice with the same configuration
- Built-in fin supports for resin printing
- Automatic per-die collections to keep multi-die scenes organized

## Tips

- The unit scale in Blender is weird and with default settings the scale of the generated STL will be off by a factor of 1000 compared to the displayed scale in Blender. To have Blender display scales that matches the resulting STL set `Scene Properties > Units > Unit Scale` to 0.001. It also helps to set the length unit to millimeters.
- If the dice disappears when enabling the boolean modifier, try ticking the `Self` option under the solver options for the Exact solver. Or try switching to the Fast solver.
